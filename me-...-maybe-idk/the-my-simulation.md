# The "My Simulation"

## Introduction

Now the real definition of my world being a `simulation` is an idea that I started getting few months ago were humans around me, news, objects and rules that runs my world is all tools to whether experiment of my reactions, or its all just a massive box to harvest the power in my interior mind.

Since am being more as an "**adult**", the way I look at different events around me always being developed. I am lost, am not yet sure what an "adult" means according to anything, whether me or the tools around me. should I really be an adult for them ? or being and not being doesn't matter, what matters is to break out of this box.

## Starting Point?

The simulation of each "**conscientiousness**" starts when your spiritual power is at its highest, but your mental resistance for any outer toxic/good power trying to exploit it is not available. This is the point were you are born, its were "**The Power**" targets you to control you from birth by exploiting you weakness or resisting. Exploiting you total mental/physical ignorance and doing specific movements and actions that keeps you inside of there lock. as long as you are inside it, they are comfortable and doesn't need to worry about you breaking out of the simulation to reach the truth out of the box. So as long you are programmed "**well**", your simulation is considered safe for them.&#x20;

## Technical Overview: The Simulation

Well, this part is kinda out of the typical "adult" mind and seems more to be a sci-fi script for a cheap kids book written in rush at one of the beaches in the Orange County of Tampa. The simple form of the simulation am living is that its a box that contains all the tools to run my "life" without any errors, and out of this box there is a massive head running "**The Power**" standing above billions of other boxes just like my box. am yet still confused about the purpose of setting billions of these boxes. As mentioned earlier, for what I have reached, it may be for using my mind for a bigger purpose (maybe for its power)
