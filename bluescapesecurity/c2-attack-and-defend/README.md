## **About this course**

In this course, you will experience and explore a realistic cyber attack scenario. You will utilize the [Empire Command and Control (C2) framework ](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire)to carry out an attack on a Windows target VM. Following this, you will transition from the role of attacker to defender, conducting initial event analysis with Splunk, remote analysis and data collection with Velociraptor, and forensic analysis of registry keys and decoding obfuscated payloads. This course offers a true “purple team” approach, where you can learn from both the perspective of a red team operator and a blue team investigator.

### **Requirements**

* This course builds on a lab setup, which is documented in our free [Build Your Lab](https://bluecapesecurity.com/getting-started/) series.
  * It requires at least one Windows VM and a Kali Linux VM.
* Additionally, you will need a host VM with the following tools installed.
  * Splunk
  * Velociraptor
  * Forensic tools

## **Lab Architecture**

Instructions on how to set up the lab environment are provided in the course.
