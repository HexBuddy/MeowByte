### this book will cover all the range of knowledge i gain about the modern age of computing because i am smart and you are not.

## Whoami ?

Honestly I still dont know who is this person writing and still didn't discover if am living in a simulation controlled and commanded by a big power that controlled my spirit since- .... Nvm, i overthink a lot

anyways i am defined in this simulation to be an 18 years old computer addict and personalized with ADHD, that have mental and social problems, also a gym rat. Dropped off college because me = no money, also love religion and philosophy and abstract mathematics. because again, am smart and you are not.
